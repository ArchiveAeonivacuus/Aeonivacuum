# Aeonivacuum - 瀛寰
<font face="Times New Roman">This is a repository about a constructed world created by the Wasacra Tanja Magic Orchestra(<b><i>Ƿasacra Tanɪa Mağuctɪc Orcestrá</i></b>), called "Aeonivacuum". By the way, the adjective form is "Aeonivacuus". The Sino-cultural name is "</font><font face="MS Mincho">瀛寰</font><font face="Times New Roman">" (Yinghuan in Mandarin, Eikan in Japanese, and Iengxuan in Iangdom Chinese).
The constructed world is about a world elsewhere in the universe (or not), which is completely different from the Earth. It is mainly constructed via words, while a few images are used. The contents of Aeonivacuum mainly focuses on its society (mainly lower classes), constructed language and unique rules of how the world operates.
Aeonivacuum does NOT have a specified theme. However, Aeonivacuum sometimes highlights to inspect humanity from a perspective outside from humanity.
The languages mainly used in documents Aeonivacuus is Chinese (mostly simplified, but sometimes traditional), sometimes Japanese (both modern Japanese and Middle Japanese are used). So sorry for those who do not understand these languages, although nearly nobody would read these, I think.</font>
